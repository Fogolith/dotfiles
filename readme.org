Here are my dotfiles. Feel free to fork and/or use and/or ignore.

It's obviously tailored more towards my usage, which is [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] with [[http://cedet.sourceforge.net/][CEDET]] and [[http://www.zsh.org/][zsh]] with [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]]. Recently I have been experimenting with the [[http://i3wm.org/][i3 tiling window manager]], which is nice.

Basic setup is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/randomphrase/dotfiles .dotfiles
$ .dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will attempt to set up symlinks from ~.dotfiles/foo~ to ~.foo~. If you already have a ~.foo~, move it out of the way (or not!) and re-run ~bootstrap.sh~. The ~bootstrap.sh~ file is intended to be re-run periodically; there are some external emacs libraries like CEDET which I use directly from their repo, and the bootstrap script does an update and rebuild of these.
